/*
In this example, we have a Card script that is attached to each card GameObject in the Unity scene. 
The script has references to the card flip animation, and sound effects for flipping a card, placing a card, 
and opponent's card flipping. The Card script has methods FlipCard(), PlaceCard(), OpponentFlipCard() that can 
be called whenever the corresponding actions happen in the game.

The FlipCard() method plays the flip sound effect and triggers the card flip animation.

The PlaceCard() method plays the place sound effect.

The OpponentFlipCard() method plays the opponent flip sound effect.

You can call these methods from other scripts in your game, such as the GameManager script, to play
 the animations and sound effects at the appropriate times.

This is just one example of how you could handle animations and sounds in your card game, you can use 
many different ways to handle them in Unity, and the best one for you might depend on the specific requirements of your game.
